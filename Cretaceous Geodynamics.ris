AB  - We present a revised global plate motion model with continuously closing plate boundaries ranging from the Triassic at 230 Ma to the present day, assess differences among alternative absolute plate motion models, and review global tectonic events. Relatively high mean absolute plate motion rates of approximately 9–10 cm yr−1 between 140 and 120 Ma may be related to transient plate motion accelerations driven by the successive emplacement of a sequence of large igneous provinces during that time. An event at ∼100 Ma is most clearly expressed in the Indian Ocean and may reflect the initiation of Andean-style subduction along southern continental Eurasia, whereas an acceleration at ∼80 Ma of mean rates from 6 to 8 cm yr−1 reflects the initial northward acceleration of India and simultaneous speedups of plates in the Pacific. An event at ∼50 Ma expressed in relative, and some absolute, plate motion changes around the globe and in a reduction of global mean plate speeds from about 6 to 4–5 cm yr−1 indicates that an increase in collisional forces (such as the India–Eurasia collision) and ridge subduction events in the Pacific (such as the Izanagi–Pacific Ridge) play a significant role in modulating plate velocities.

AB  - Global plate motion models provide a spatial and temporal framework for geological data and have been effective tools for exploring processes occurring at the earth's surface. However, published models either have insufficient temporal coverage or fail to treat tectonic plates in a self-consistent manner. They usually consider the motions of selected features attached to tectonic plates, such as continents, but generally do not explicitly account for the continuous evolution of plate boundaries through time. In order to explore the coupling between the surface and mantle, plate models are required that extend over at least a few hundred million years and treat plates as dynamic features with dynamically evolving plate boundaries. We have constructed a new type of global plate motion model consisting of a set of continuously-closing topological plate polygons with associated plate boundaries and plate velocities since the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea. Our model is underpinned by plate motions derived from reconstructing the seafloor-spreading history of the ocean basins and motions of the continents and utilizes a hybrid absolute reference frame, based on a moving hotspot model for the last 100Ma, and a true-polar wander corrected paleomagnetic model for 200 to 100Ma. Detailed regional geological and geophysical observations constrain plate boundary inception or cessation, and time-dependent geometry. Although our plate model is primarily designed as a reference model for a new generation of geodynamic studies by providing the surface boundary conditions for the deep earth, it is also useful for studies in disparate fields when a framework is needed for analyzing and interpreting spatio-temporal data.

T2  - Tectonophysics
AB  - Ascertaining the cause of variations in the frequency of geomagnetic polarity reversals through the Phanerozoic has remained a primary research question straddling paleomagnetism and geodynamics for decades. Numerical models suggest the primary control on geomagnetic reversal rates on 10 to 100 Ma timescales is the changing heat flux across the core-mantle boundary and that this is itself expected to be strongly influenced by variations in the flux of lithosphere subducted into the mantle. A positive relationship between the time-dependent global subduction flux and magnetic reversal rate is expected, with a time delay to transmit the thermal imprint into the lowermost mantle. We perform the first test of this hypothesis using subduction flux estimates and geomagnetic reversal rate data back to the early Paleozoic. Subduction area flux estimates are derived from global, full-plate tectonic models, and are evaluated against independent subduction flux proxies based on the global age distribution of detrital zircons and strontium isotopes. A continuous Phanerozoic reversal rate model is built from pre-existing compilations back to ~320 Ma plus a new reversal rate model in the data-sparse mid-to-early Paleozoic. Cross-correlation of the time-dependent subduction flux and geomagnetic reversal rate series reveals a significant correlation with a time delay of ~120 Ma (with reversals trailing the subduction flux). This time delay represents a value intermediate between the seismologically constrained time expected for a subducted slab to transit from the surface to the core-mantle boundary (~150–300 Ma), and the much shorter lag time predicted by some numerical models of mantle flow (~30–60 Ma). While the reason for this large discrepancy remains unclear, it is encouraging that our novel estimate of lag time represents a compromise between them. Although important uncertainties in our proposed relationship remain, these results cast new light on the dynamic connections between the surface and deep Earth, and will help to constrain new models linking mantle convection, the thermal evolution of the lowermost mantle and the geodynamo.

              Although plate tectonics is generally considered to be the main contributor of CO
              2
              production, despite decades of paleoproxy and solid-earth research, this very first-order assumption remains unproven. Based on estimates of total subduction-zone lengths, from a combined analysis of seismic tomography models and plate tectonic reconstructions, we have bridged a major gap between solid-earth sciences and the atmosphere and biosphere sciences by providing understanding of one of the most fundamental controls of climate: variation of plate tectonic activity of our planet. By using the subduction zone length input into the GEOCARBSULF climate model, we obtain a better fit with atmospheric CO
              2
              proxies compared with previously used plate tectonic assumptions.
            
          , 
            
              Climate trends on timescales of 10s to 100s of millions of years are controlled by changes in solar luminosity, continent distribution, and atmosphere composition. Plate tectonics affect geography, but also atmosphere composition through volcanic degassing of CO
              2
              at subduction zones and midocean ridges. So far, such degassing estimates were based on reconstructions of ocean floor production for the last 150 My and indirectly, through sea level inversion before 150 My. Here we quantitatively estimate CO
              2
              degassing by reconstructing lithosphere subduction evolution, using recent advances in combining global plate reconstructions and present-day structure of the mantle. First, we estimate that since the Triassic (250–200 My) until the present, the total paleosubduction-zone length reached up to ∼200% of the present-day value. Comparing our subduction-zone lengths with previously reconstructed ocean-crust production rates over the past 140 My suggests average global subduction rates have been constant, ∼6 cm/y: Higher ocean-crust production is associated with longer total subduction length. We compute a strontium isotope record based on subduction-zone length, which agrees well with geological records supporting the validity of our approach: The total subduction-zone length is proportional to the summed arc and ridge volcanic CO
              2
              production and thereby to global volcanic degassing at plate boundaries. We therefore use our degassing curve as input for the GEOCARBSULF model to estimate atmospheric CO
              2
              levels since the Triassic. Our calculated CO
              2
              levels for the mid Mesozoic differ from previous modeling results and are more consistent with available proxy data.

AB  - <p>Carbon is a key control on the surface chemistry and climate of Earth. Significant volumes of carbon are input to the oceans and atmosphere from deep Earth in the form of degassed CO<sub>2</sub> and are returned to large carbon reservoirs in the mantle via subduction or burial. Different tectonic settings (e.g., volcanic arcs, mid-ocean ridges, and continental rifts) emit fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> that are temporally and spatially variable, and together they represent a first-order control on carbon outgassing from the deep Earth. A change in the relative importance of different tectonic settings throughout Earth’s history has therefore played a key role in balancing the deep carbon cycle on geological timescales. Over the past 10 years the <italic>Deep Carbon Observatory</italic> has made enormous progress in constraining estimates of carbon outgassing flux at different tectonic settings. Using plate boundary evolution modeling and our understanding of present-day carbon fluxes, we develop time series of carbon fluxes into and out of the Earth’s interior through the past 200 million years. We highlight the increasing importance of carbonate-intersecting subduction zones over time to carbon outgassing, and the possible dominance of carbon outgassing at continental rift zones, which leads to maxima in outgassing at 130 and 15 Ma. To a first-order, carbon outgassing since 200 Ma may be net positive, averaging ∼50 Mt C yr<sup>–1</sup> more than the ingassing flux at subduction zones. Our net outgassing curve is poorly correlated with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, implying that surface carbon cycling processes play a significant role in modulating carbon concentrations and/or there is a long-term crustal or lithospheric storage of carbon which modulates the outgassing flux. Our results highlight the large uncertainties that exist in reconstructing the corresponding in- and outgassing fluxes of carbon. Our synthesis summarizes our current understanding of fluxes at tectonic settings and their influence on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and provides a framework for future research into Earth’s deep carbon cycling, both today and in the past.</p>

AU  - Doucet, Luc S.

T2  - Nature Geoscience
AB  - The Earth’s mantle is divided by the circum-Pacific subduction girdle into the African and Pacific domains, each featuring a large low-shear-wave-velocity province (LLSVP) in the lower mantle. However, how this hemispherical-scale mantle structure links to Earth’s plate tectonic evolution remains unclear. Previous geochemical work has suggested the presence of a north–south hemispheric subdivision, with large-scale mantle heterogeneities in the Southern Hemisphere, termed the DUPAL (Dupré and Allegre) anomaly. Here we compile elemental and isotopic data of both shallow-mantle-derived oceanic igneous rocks from mid-ocean ridges and deeper-mantle plume-related samples (ocean islands and oceanic plateaus) and analyse these using supervised machine learning classification methods. Data from both shallow- and deeper-mantle-sourced samples illustrate a consistent chemical dichotomy. Our results indicate that heterogeneities in the present-day shallow and deep mantle are not exclusively controlled by the north–south hemispheric DUPAL anomaly. Instead, they are consistent with a chemical dichotomy between the African and Pacific mantle domains and their associated LLSVPs. These observations can best be explained by tectonic supercycles over the past one billion years involving two supercontinents and two superoceans.

AB  - Abstract At the core-mantle boundary, most observed ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs) cluster along the edges of the large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) and provide key information on the composition, dynamics, and evolution of the lower mantle. However, their detailed structure near slab-like structures beneath the mid-Pacific remains particularly challenging because of the lack of station coverage. While most studies of ULVZs concentrate on SKS-complexity, here we report on the multipathing of ScS, which expands the sampling for ULVZs. We find the strongest multipathing along a ULVZ patch located just south of Hawaii and the far northeastern edge of the LLSVP, in a zone ~200 km in width and extending 600 km southward. The anomalous ScS travel times and distorted Sdiff waveforms further reveal patches interrupted by observed enhanced D? indicative of slab-debris influence on the complexity of the northeastern boundary of the mid-Pacific LLSVP.

AB  - Processes within the lowest several hundred kilometers of Earth's rocky mantle play a critical role in the evolution of the planet. Understanding Earth's lower mantle requires putting recent seismic and mineral physics discoveries into a self-consistent, geodynamically feasible context. Two nearly antipodal large low-shear-velocity provinces in the deep mantle likely represent chemically distinct and denser material. High-resolution seismological studies have revealed laterally varying seismic velocity discontinuities in the deepest few hundred kilometers, consistent with a phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite. In the deepest tens of kilometers of the mantle, isolated pockets of ultralow seismic velocities may denote Earth's deepest magma chamber.

AB  - The Pacific large low-shear-velocity province (LLSVP), as revealed by cluster analysis of global tomographic models, hosts multiple internal anomalies, including a notable gap (~20° wide) between the central and eastern Pacific. The cause of the structural gap remains unconstrained. Directly above this structural gap, we identify an anomalously thick mantle transition zone east of the East Pacific Rise, the fastest-spreading ocean ridge in the world, using a dense set of SS precursors. The area of the thickened transition zone exhibits faster-than-average velocities according to recent tomographic images, suggesting perturbed postolivine phase boundaries shifting in response to lowered temperatures. We attribute this observation to episodes of Mesozoic-aged (250 to 120 million years ago) intraoceanic subduction beneath the present-day Nazca Plate. The eastern portion of the Pacific LLSVP was separated by downwelling because of this ancient oceanic slab. Our discovery provides a unique perspective on linking deep Earth structures with surface subduction.

AB  - Seismic studies have revealed two Large Low-Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in the lowermost mantle. Whether these structures remain stable over time or evolve through supercontinent cycles is debated. Here we analyze a recently published mantle flow model constrained by a synthetic plate motion model extending back to one billion years ago, to investigate how the mantle evolves in response to changing plate configurations. Our model predicts that sinking slabs segment the basal thermochemical structure below an assembling supercontinent, and that this structure eventually becomes unified due to slab push from circum-supercontinental subduction. In contrast, the basal thermochemical structure below the superocean is generally coherent due to the persistence of a superocean in our imposed plate reconstruction. The two antipodal basal thermochemical structures exchange material several times when part of one of the structures is carved out and merged with the other one, similarly to “exotic” tectonic terranes. Plumes mostly rise from thick basal thermochemical structures and in some instances migrate from the edges towards the interior of basal thermochemical structures due to slab push. Our results suggest that the topography of basal structures and distribution of plumes change over time due to the changing subduction network over supercontinent cycles.

AB  - AbstractThe relationships between plate motions and basal mantle structure remain poorly understood, with some models implying that the basal mantle structure has remained stable over time, while others suggest that it could be shaped by the aggregation and dispersal of supercontinents. Here we investigate the evolution of mantle flow driven by end-member plate tectonic models over 1 Gyr. We implement a tectonic scenario in which supercontinent reassembly occurs by introversion, and consider three distinct references frames that result in different net lithospheric rotation. Our flow models predict a dominant degree-2 mantle structure most of the time. We analyze the relationship between imposed tectonic velocities and deep mantle flow, and find that at spherical harmonic degree 2, the maxima of lower mantle radial flow and temperature follow the motion path of the maxima of surface divergence. It may take ∼160–240 Myr for lower mantle structure to reflect plate motion changes when the lower mantle is reorganized by slabs sinking onto basal thermochemical structures, and/or when slabs stagnate in the transition zone before sinking to the lower mantle. Basal thermochemical structures move at less than 0.6°/Myr in our models, with a temporal average of 0.16°/Myr when there is no net lithospheric rotation, and between 0.20 and 0.23°/Myr when net lithospheric rotation exists and is induced in the lower mantle. Our results suggest that basal thermochemical structures are not stationary, but rather linked to global plate motions and plate boundary reconfigurations, reflecting the dynamic nature of the coevolving plate-mantle system.

T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth
AB  - A strong 50–35 Ma decrease in India-Asia convergence is generally ascribed to continent-continent collision. However, a convergence rate increase of similar magnitude occurred between ∼65–50 Ma. An earlier increase occurred at ∼90 Ma. Both episodes of accelerated convergence followed upon arrival of a mantle plume below and emplacement of a large igneous province (LIP) on the Indian plate. We here first confirm these convergence rate trends, reassessing the Indo-Atlantic plate circuits. Then, using two different numerical models, we assess whether plume head arrival and its lateral asthenospheric flow may explain the plate velocity increases and whether decreased plume flux and increasing continent-plume distance may explain deceleration, even without continental collision. The results show that plume head arrival can indeed lead to absolute Indian plate motion accelerations on the order of several cm/yr, followed by decelerations on timescales similar to the reconstructed fluctuations. The 90 Ma increase could potentially be explained as response to the Morondova mantle plume alone. The 65–50 Ma convergence rate increase, however, is larger than can be explained by plume head spreading alone. We concur with previous hypotheses that plume-induced weakening of the Indian continental lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling and an increased slab pull and ridge push efficiency are the most likely explanations for the large convergence rate increase. The post-50 Ma decrease is best explained by orogeny-related increased trench resistivity, decreased slab pull due to continental subduction, and possibly restrengthening of lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling upon plume demise.

AU  - Eagles, Graeme

AB  - The buoyancy of lithospheric slabs in subduction zones is widely thought to dominate the torques driving plate tectonics. In late Cretaceous and early Paleogene times, the Indian plate moved more rapidly over the mantle than freely subducting slabs sink within it. This signal event has been attributed to arrival of the Deccan–Réunion mantle plume beneath the plate, but it is unknown in which proportions the plume acted to alter the balance of existing plate driving torques and to introduce torques of its own. Our plate kinematic analysis of the Mascarene Basin yields a detailed Indian plate motion history for the period 89–60 Ma. Plate speed initially increases steadily until a pronounced acceleration in the period 68–64 Ma, after which it abruptly returns to values much like those beforehand. This pattern is unlike that suggested to result from the direct introduction of driving forces by the arrival of a thermal plume at the base of the plate. A simple analysis of the gravitational force related to the Indian plate's thickening away from its boundary with the African plate suggests instead that the sudden acceleration and deceleration may be related to uplift of part of that boundary during a period when it was located over the plume head. In this instance, torques related to plate accretion and subduction may have contributed in similar proportions to drive plate motion.

AB  - We present analogue models simulating the subduction of an oceanic lithosphere beneath an overriding plate advancing at variable rates. The convergence velocity is imposed by lateral boundary conditions in this experimental set. We analyze the geometry of the slab and the deformation of the overriding plate. Experiments confirm the strong correlation between the absolute velocity of the overriding plate on the one hand, the geometry of the subducting plate and the deformation of the overriding plate on the other hand. Following an instantaneous change in kinematic boundary conditions, the subduction system progressively shifts to a new steady-state regime. Models suggest that the adjustment time necessary to shift from the previous to the new equilibrium is independent of the imposed upper plate velocity. Transient stage lasts ∼ 12.5 ± 6 m.y. for the shallow slab dip (100–150-km depth), ∼ 29.2 ± 10 m.y. for the deeper slab dip (300–350-km depth), and ∼ 2.2 ± 2 m.y. for the upper plate deformation. The analysis of present-day subduction zones and their evolution through the last 20 m.y suggests an adjustment time of ∼15 m.y. for shallow slab dip and ∼20 m.y. for deep slab dip in Nature. Since only few subduction zones have shown a constant upper plate velocity over the last 15 m.y., it suggests that most of them are in a transient stage at present-day.

TI  - A geodynamic model of subduction evolution and slab detachment to explain Australian plate acceleration and deceleration during the latest Cretaceous–early Cenozoic
AU  - Schellart, W.P.
T2  - Lithosphere
AB  - During the latest Cretaceous–early Cenozoic, the northern margin of the Australian plate was characterized by a large (4000 km wide) north- to northeast-dipping subduction zone (New Guinea–Pocklington subduction zone) consuming a marginal basin. Geological and geophysical data imply that the subduction zone was active ca. 71–50 Ma, and suggest that it was responsible for plate acceleration from ∼1.0 to ∼7.3 cm/yr ca. 64–59 Ma, and plate deceleration from ∼7.3 to ∼0.3 cm/yr at 52–49 Ma. This paper presents a numerical model of buoyancy-driven subduction to test if the rates of Australian plate acceleration and deceleration can be ascribed to the progressive evolution of a subducting slab. The geodynamic model reproduces the first-order plate velocity evolution of the Australian plate, with a transient ∼5 m.y. period of acceleration from 2 to 8 cm/yr during upper mantle slab lengthening, an ∼5 m.y. period of rapid plate motion (∼5–8 cm/yr), and a short, 3.9 m.y., period of plate deceleration, starting with a 2 cm/yr velocity drop during 3.1 m.y. of continental subduction and followed by ∼0.8 m.y. of rapid deceleration (4 cm/yr velocity drop) during slab detachment. The geodynamic model demonstrates that plate velocity increases or decreases of ∼4–6 cm/yr can occur over a period lasting &lt;1 m.y. to a few million years, comparable to what is observed for the latest Cretaceous–early Cenozoic evolution of the Australian plate. Such rates of plate acceleration and deceleration could be tested against plate kinematic data for other subduction settings on Earth.

AB  - Subduction is a fundamental mechanism of material exchange between the planetary interior and the surface. Despite its significance, our current understanding of fluctuating subducting plate area and slab volume flux has been limited to a range of proxy estimates. Here we present a new detailed quantification of subduction zone parameters from the Late Triassic to present day (230–0 Ma). We use a community plate motion model with evolving plate topologies to extract trench-normal convergence rates through time to compute subducting plate areas, and we use seafloor paleo-age grids to estimate the thickness of subducting lithosphere to derive the slab flux through time. Our results imply that slab flux doubled to values greater than 500 km3/yr from 180 Ma in the Jurassic to 130 Ma in the mid-Cretaceous, subsequently halving again towards the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, largely driven by subduction zones rimming the Pacific ocean basin. The 130 Ma spike can be attributed to a two-fold increase in mid-ocean ridge lengths following the break-up of Pangea, and a coincident increase in convergence rates, with average speeds exceeding 10 cm/yr. With one third of the total 230 - 0 Ma subducted volume entering the mantle during this short ∼50 Myr period, we suggest this slab superflux drove a surge in slab penetration into the lower mantle and an associated increase in the vigour of mantle return flow. This mid-Cretaceous event may have triggered, or at least contributed to, the formation of the Darwin Rise mantle superswell, dynamic uplift of the South African Plateau and the plume pulse that produced the Ontong-Java-Hikurangi-Manihiki and Kerguelen plateaus, among others. The models presented here contribute to an improved understanding of the time-evolving flux of material consumed by subduction, and suggest that slab superflux may be a general feature of continental dispersal following supercontinent breakup. These insights may be useful for better understanding how supercontinent cycles are related to transient episodes of Large Igneous Province and superswell formation, and the associated deep cycling of minerals and volatiles, as well as leading to a better understanding of tectonic drivers of long-term climate and icehouse-to-greenhouse transitions.

AB  - Plate tectonics drives the compositional diversity of Earth’s convecting mantle through subduction of lithosphere. In this context, the role of evolving global geodynamics and plate (re)organization on the spatial and temporal distribution of compositional heterogeneities in the convecting mantle is poorly understood. Here, using the geochemical compositions of intracontinental basalts formed over the past billion years, we show that intracontinental basalts with subchondritic initial neodymium-144/neodymium-143 values become common only after 300 million years, broadly coeval with the global appearance of kimberlites with geochemically enriched isotopic signatures. These step changes in the sources of intraplate magmatism stem from a rapid increase in the supply of deeply subducted lithosphere during the protracted formation of Pangea following the widespread onset of “modern” (cold and deep) subduction in the late Neoproterozoic. We argue that the delay (~300 million years) in the appearance of enriched intraplate magmas reflects the time required for the sinking and (re)incorporation of slabs into the sources of mantle-derived magmas.

AB  - The motion of plates and continents on the planet's surface are a manifestation of long-term mantle convection and plate tectonics. Present-day plate velocities provide a snapshot of this ongoing process, and have been used to infer controlling factors on the speeds of plates and continents. However, present-day velocities do not capture plate behaviour over geologically representative periods of time. To address this shortcoming, we use a plate tectonic reconstruction approach to extract time-dependent plate velocities and geometries from which root mean square (RMS) velocities are computed, resulting in a median RMS plate speed of ∼4 cm/yr over 200 Myr. Linking tectonothermal ages of continental lithosphere to the RMS plate velocity analysis, we find that the increasing portions of plate area composed of continental and/or cratonic lithosphere significantly reduces plate speeds. Plates with any cratonic portion have a median RMS velocity of ∼5.8 cm/yr, while plates with more than 25% of cratonic area have a median RMS speed of ∼2.8 cm/yr. The fastest plates (∼8.5 cm/yr RMS speed) have little continental fraction and tend to be bounded by subduction zones, while the slowest plates (∼2.6–2.8 cm/yr RMS speed) have large continental fractions and usually have little to no subducting part of plate perimeter. More generally, oceanic plates tend to move 2–3 times faster than continental plates, consistent with predictions of numerical models of mantle convection. The slower motion of continental plates is compatible with deep keels impinging on asthenospheric flow and increasing shear traction, thus anchoring the plate in the more viscous mantle transition zone. We also find that short-lived (up to ∼10 Myr) rapid accelerations of Africa (∼100 and 65 Ma), North America (∼100 and 55 Ma) and India (∼130,80 and 65 Ma) appear to be correlated with plume head arrivals as recorded by large igneous province (LIPs) emplacement. By evaluating factors influencing plate speeds over the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, our temporal analysis reveals simple principles that can guide the construction and evaluation of absolute plate motion models for times before the Cretaceous in the absence of hotspot tracks and seafloor spreading histories. Based on the post-Pangea plate motions, one principle that can be applied to pre-Pangea times is that plates with less than ∼50% continental area can reach RMS velocities of ∼20 cm/yr, while plates with more than 50% continental fraction do not exceed RMS velocities of ∼10 cm/yr. Similarly, plates with large portions of continental or cratonic area with RMS velocities exceeding ∼15 cm/yr for more than ∼10 Myr should be considered as potential artefacts requiring further justification of plate driving forces in such scenarios.

AB  - We present a revised global plate motion model with continuously closing plate boundaries ranging from the Triassic at 230 Ma to the present day, assess differences among alternative absolute plate motion models, and review global tectonic events. Relatively high mean absolute plate motion rates of approximately 9–10 cm yr−1 between 140 and 120 Ma may be related to transient plate motion accelerations driven by the successive emplacement of a sequence of large igneous provinces during that time. An event at ∼100 Ma is most clearly expressed in the Indian Ocean and may reflect the initiation of Andean-style subduction along southern continental Eurasia, whereas an acceleration at ∼80 Ma of mean rates from 6 to 8 cm yr−1 reflects the initial northward acceleration of India and simultaneous speedups of plates in the Pacific. An event at ∼50 Ma expressed in relative, and some absolute, plate motion changes around the globe and in a reduction of global mean plate speeds from about 6 to 4–5 cm yr−1 indicates that an increase in collisional forces (such as the India–Eurasia collision) and ridge subduction events in the Pacific (such as the Izanagi–Pacific Ridge) play a significant role in modulating plate velocities.

AB  - Global deep-time plate motion models have traditionally followed a classical rigid plate approach, even though plate deformation is known to be significant. Here we present a global Mesozoic–Cenozoic deforming plate motion model that captures the progressive extension of all continental margins since the initiation of rifting within Pangea at 240 Ma. The model also includes major failed continental rifts and compressional deformation along collision zones. The outlines and timing of regional deformation episodes are reconstructed from a wealth of published regional tectonic models and associated geological and geophysical data. We reconstruct absolute plate motions in a mantle reference frame with a joint global inversion using hot spot tracks for the last 80 million years and minimizing global trench migration velocities and net lithospheric rotation. In our optimized model, net rotation is consistently below 0.2°/Myr, and trench migration scatter is substantially reduced. Distributed plate deformation reaches a Mesozoic peak of 30 × 106 km2 in the Late Jurassic ( 160–155 Ma), driven by a vast network of rift systems. After a mid-Cretaceous drop in deformation, it reaches a high of 48 x 106 km2 in the Late Eocene ( 35 Ma), driven by the progressive growth of plate collisions and the formation of new rift systems. About a third of the continental crustal area has been deformed since 240 Ma, partitioned roughly into 65% extension and 35% compression. This community plate model provides a framework for building detailed regional deforming plate networks and form a constraint for models of basin evolution and the plate-mantle system.

AB  - Periodic assembly and dispersal of continental fragments has been a characteristic of the solid Earth for much of its history. Geodynamic drivers of this cyclic activity are inferred to be either top-down processes related to near surface lithospheric stresses at plate boundaries or bottom-up processes related to mantle convection and, in particular, mantle plumes, or some combination of the two. Analysis of the geological history of Rodinian crustal blocks suggests that internal rifting and breakup of the supercontinent were linked to the initiation of subduction and development of accretionary orogens around its periphery. Thus, breakup was a top-down instigated process. The locus of convergence was initially around north-eastern and northern Laurentia in the early Neoproterozoic before extending to outboard of Amazonia and Africa, including Avalonia–Cadomia, and arcs outboard of Siberia and eastern to northern Baltica in the mid-Neoproterozoic (∼760 Ma). The duration of subduction around the periphery of Rodinia coincides with the interval of lithospheric extension within the supercontinent, including the opening of the proto-Pacific at ca. 760 Ma and the commencement of rifting in east Laurentia. Final development of passive margin successions around Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia was not completed until the late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic (ca. 570–530 Ma), which corresponds with the termination of convergent plate interactions that gave rise to Gondwana and the consequent relocation of subduction zones to the periphery of this supercontinent. The temporal link between external subduction and internal extension suggests that breakup was initiated by a top-down process driven by accretionary tectonics along the periphery of the supercontinent. Plume-related magmatism may be present at specific times and in specific places during breakup but is not the prime driving force. Comparison of the Rodinia record of continental assembly and dispersal with that for Nuna, Gondwana and Pangea suggests grouping into two supercycles in which Nuna and Gondwana underwent only partial or no break-up phase prior to their incorporation into Rodinia and Pangea respectively. It was only after this final phase of assembly that the supercontinents then underwent full dispersal.

AU  - Bortolotti, Valerio

T2  - Island Arc
AB  - The break-up of Pangea began during the Triassic and was preceded by a generalized Permo-Triassic formation of continental rifts along the future margins between Africa and Europe, between Africa and North America, and between North and South America. During the Middle–Late Triassic, an ocean basin cutting the eastern equatorial portion of the Pangea opened as a prograding branch of the Paleotethys or as a new ocean (the Eastern Tethys); westwards, continental rift basins developed. The Western Tethys and Central Atlantic began to open only during the Middle Jurassic. The timing of the break-up can be hypothesized from data from the oceanic remnants of the peri-Mediterranean and peri-Caribbean regions (the Mesozoic ophiolites) and from the Atlantic ocean crust. In the Eastern Tethys, Middle–Late Triassic mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB) ophiolites, Middle–Upper Jurassic MORB, island arc tholeiite (IAT) supra-subduction ophiolites and Middle–Upper Jurassic metamorphic soles occur, suggesting that the ocean drifting was active from the Triassic to the Middle Jurassic. The compressive phases, as early as during the Middle Jurassic, were when the drifting was still active and caused the ocean closure at the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary and, successively, the formation of the orogenic belts. The present scattering of the ophiolites is a consequence of the orogenesis: once the tectonic disturbances are removed, the Eastern Tethys ophiolites constitute a single alignment. In the Western Tethys only Middle–Upper Jurassic MORB ophiolites are present – this was the drifting time. The closure began during the Late Cretaceous and was completed during the Eocene. Along the area linking the Western Tethys to the Central Atlantic, the break-up was realized through left lateral wrench movements. In the Central Atlantic – the link between the Western Tethys and the Caribbean Tethys – the drifting began at the same time and is still continuing. The Caribbean Tethys opened probably during the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous. The general picture rising from the previous data suggest a Pangea break-up rejuvenating from east to west, from the Middle–Late Triassic to the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous.

TI  - Trench migration and overriding plate stress in dynamic subduction models
AU  - Holt, A. F.
AU  - Becker, T. W.
AU  - Buffett, B. A.
T2  - Geophysical Journal International
AB  - On Earth, oceanic plates subduct beneath a variety of overriding plate (OP) styles, from relatively thin and negatively buoyant oceanic OPs to thick and neutrally/positively buoyant continental OPs. The inclusion of an OP in numerical models of self-consistent subduction has been shown to reduce the rate that subducting slabs roll back relative to the equivalent single plate models. We use dynamic, 2-D subduction models to investigate how the mechanical properties, namely viscosity, thickness, and density, of the OP modify the slab rollback rate and the state of stress of the OP. In addition, we examine the role of the subducting plate (SP) viscosity. Because OP deformation accommodates the difference between the slab rollback rate and the far-field OP velocity, we find that the temporal variations in the rollback rate results in temporal variations in OP stress. The slabs in our models roll back rapidly until they reach the lower mantle viscosity increase, at which point the rollback velocity decreases. Concurrent with this reduction in rollback rate is a switch from an OP dominated by extensional stresses to a compressional OP. As in single plate models, the viscosity of the SP exerts a strong control on subducting slab kinematics; weaker slabs exhibit elevated sinking velocities and rollback rates. The SP viscosity also exerts a strong control on the OP stress regime. Weak slabs, either due to reduced bulk viscosity or stress-dependent weakening, have compressional OPs, while strong slabs have dominantly extensional OPs. While varying the viscosity of the OP alone does not substantially affect the OP stress state, we find that the OP thickness and buoyancy plays a substantial role in dictating the rate of slab rollback and OP stress state. Models with thick and/or negatively buoyant OPs have reduced rollback rates, and increased slab dip angles, relative to slabs with thin and/or positively buoyant OPs. Such elevated trench rollback for models with positively buoyant OPs induces extensional stresses in the OP, while OPs that are strongly negatively buoyant are under compression. While rollback is driven by the negative buoyancy of the subducting slab in such models of free subduction, we conclude that the physical properties of the OP potentially play a significant role in modulating both rollback rates and OP deformation style on Earth.

TI  - The dominant driving force for supercontinent breakup: Plume push or subduction retreat?
AU  - Zhang, Nan

T2  - Geoscience Frontiers
AB  - Understanding the dominant force responsible for supercontinent breakup is crucial for establishing Earth's geodynamic evolution that includes supercontinent cycles and plate tectonics. Conventionally, two forces have been considered: the push by mantle plumes from the sub-continental mantle which is called the active force for breakup, and the dragging force from oceanic subduction retreat which is called the passive force for breakup. However, the relative importance of these two forces is unclear. Here we model the supercontinent breakup coupled with global mantle convection in order to address this question. Our global model features a spherical harmonic degree-2 structure, which includes a major subduction girdle and two large upwelling (superplume) systems. Based on this global mantle structure, we examine the distribution of extensional stress applied to the supercontinent by both sub-supercontinent mantle upwellings and subduction retreat at the supercontinent peripheral. Our results show that: (1) at the center half of the supercontinent, plume push stress is ∼3 times larger than the stress induced by subduction retreat; (2) an average hot anomaly of no higher than 50 K beneath the supercontinent can produce a push force strong enough to cause the initialization of supercontinent breakup; (3) the extensional stress induced by subduction retreat concentrates on a ∼600 km wide zone on the boundary of the supercontinent, but has far less impact to the interior of the supercontinent. We therefore conclude that although circum-supercontinent subduction retreat assists supercontinent breakup, sub-supercontinent mantle upwelling is the essential force.

AB  - The growth curve of the continental crust shows that large amounts of continental crust formed in the early part of the Earth history are missing. In order to test a hypothesis that the former crust was subducted to the deep mantle, we performed phase assemblage analysis in the systems of mid-oceanic ridge basalt (MORB), anorthosite, and tonalite–trondhjemite–granite (TTG) down to the core–mantle boundary (CMB) conditions. Results show that all these materials can be subducted to the CMB leading to the development of a compositional layering in the D″ layer. We speculate that there could be five layers of FeO-enriched melt from partial melting of MORB, MORB crust, anorthosite, TTG, and slab or mantle peridotite in ascending order. Although the polymorphic transformation of perovskite to post-perovskite in (Mg,Fe)SiO3 may explain the seismic discontinuity at the top of the D″ layer (D″ discontinuity), the effects of solid solution on the sharpness of the transformation suggest that the compositional layering is more plausible for the origin of the D″ discontinuity. The D″ layer can be an “anti-crust” made up mostly of TTG+anorthosite derived from the former continental crust. Tectonic style of the anti-crust at the CMB is similar to that at the surface. At both places, chemically distinct layers are density stratified and are also characterized by the processes of accretion, magmatism, and metasomatism.

AB  - The breakup of continents and their subsequent drifting plays a crucial role in the Earth's periodic plate aggregation and dispersal cycles. While continental aggregation is considered the result of oceanic closure during subduction, what drives sustained divergence in the following stages remains poorly understood. In this study, thermo-mechanical numerical experiments illustrate the single contribution of subduction and coupled mantle flow to the rifting and drifting of continents. We quantify the drag exerted by subduction-induced mantle flow along the basal surface of continental plates, comparing models of lithospheric slab stagnation above the upper-lower mantle boundary with those where slabs penetrate into the lower mantle. When subduction is upper-mantle confined, divergent basal tractions localise at distances comparable to the effective upper mantle thickness (~500km), causing the opening of a marginal basin. Instead, subduction of lithosphere in the lower mantle reorganises the flow into a much wider cell localising extensional stresses at greater distances from the trench (~3000km). Sub-continental tractions are higher and more sustained over longer time periods in this case, and progressively increase as the slab sinks deeper. Although relatively low, basal-shear stresses when integrated over large plates, generate tension forces that may exceed the strength of the continental lithosphere, eventually leading to breakup and opening of a distal basin. The models illustrate the emergence of a similar mechanism, which results in the formation of back-arc basins above upper-mantle confined subduction, and scales to much larger distances for deeper subduction. Examples include the Atlantic Ocean formation and drifting of the South and North American plates during the Mesozoic-Cenozoic Farallon plate subduction.

AB  - The mechanisms of formation and disruption of supercontinents have been topics of debate. Based on the Y-shaped topology, we identify two major types of subduction zones on the globe: the Circum-Pacific subduction zone and the Tethyan subduction zone. We propose that the process of formation of supercontinents is controlled by super downwelling that develops through double-sided subduction zones as seen in the present day western Pacific, and also as endorsed by both geologic history and P-wave whole mantle tomography. The super-downwelling swallows all material like a black hole in the outer space, pulling together continents into a tight assembly. The fate of supercontinents is dictated by superplumes (super-upwelling) which break apart the continental assemblies. We evaluate the configuration of major supercontinents through Earth history and propose the tectonic framework leading to the future supercontinent Amasia 250 million years from present, with the present day Western Pacific region as its frontier. We propose that the tectosphere which functions as the buoyant keel of continental crust plays a crucial role in the supercontinental cycle, including continental fragmentation, dispersion and amalgamation. The continental crust is generally very thin, only about one tenth of the thickness of the tectosphere. If the rigidity and buoyancy is derived from the tectosphere, with the granitic upper crust playing only a negligible role, then supercontinent cycle may reflect the dispersion and amalgamation of the tectosphere. Therefore, supercontinent cycle may correspond to super-tectosphere cycle.

AB  - The Western Pacific Triangular Zone (WPTZ) is the frontier of a future supercontinent to be formed at 250 Ma after present. The WPTZ is characterized by double-sided subduction zones to the east and south, and is a region dominated by extensive refrigeration and water supply into the mantle wedge since at least 200 Ma. Long stagnant slabs extending over 1200 km are present in the mid-Mantle Boundary Layer (MBL, 410–660 km) under the WPTZ, whereas on the Core–Mantle Boundary (CMB, 2700–2900 km depth), there is a thick high-V anomaly, presumably representing a slab graveyard. To explain the D″ layer cold anomaly, catastrophic collapse of once stagnant slabs in MBL is necessary, which could have occurred at 30–20 Ma, acting as a trigger to open a series of back-arc basins, hot regions, small ocean basins, and presumably formation of a series of microplates in both ocean and continent. These events were the result of replacement of upper mantle by hotter and more fertile materials from the lower mantle. The thermal structure of the solid Earth was estimated by the phase diagrams of Mid Oceanic Ridge Basalt (MORB) and pyrolite combined with seismic discontinuity planes at 410–660 km, thickness of the D″ layers, and distribution of the ultra-low velocity zone (ULVZ). The result clearly shows the presence of two major superplumes and one downwelling. Thermal structure of the Earth seems to be controlled by the subduction history back to 180 Ma, except in the D″ layer. The thermal structure of the D″ layer seems to be controlled by older slab-graveyards, as expected by paleogeographic reconstructions for Laurasia, Gondwana and Rodinia back to 700 Ma. Comparison of mantle tomography between the Pacific superplume and underneath the WPTZ suggests the transformation of a cold slab graveyard to a large-scale mantle upwelling with time. The Pacific superplume was born from the coldest CMB underneath the 1.0–0.75 Ga supercontinent Rodinia where huge amounts of cold slabs had accumulated through collision-amalgamation of more than 12 continents. A high velocity P-wave anomaly on a whole-mantle scale shows stagnant slabs restricted to the MBL of circum-Pacific and Tethyan regions. The high velocity zones can be clearly identified within the Pacific domain, suggesting the presence of slab graveyards formed at geological periods much older than the breakup of Rodinia. We speculate that the predominant subduction occurred through the formation period of Gondwana, presumably very active during 600 to 540 Ma period, and again from 400 to 300 Ma during the formation of the northern half of Pangea (Laurasia). We correlate the three dominant slab graveyards with three major orogenies in earth history, with the emerging picture suggesting that the present-day Pacific superplume is located at the center of the Rodinian slab graveyard. We speculate the mechanism of superplume formation through a comparison of the thermal structure of the mantle combined with seismic tomography under the Western Pacific Triangular Zone (WPTZ), Laurasia (Asia), Gondwana (Africa), and Rodinia (Pacific). The coldest mantle formed by extensive subduction to generate a supercontinent, changes with time of the order of several hundreds of million years to the hottest mantle underneath the supercontinent. The Pacific superplume is tightly defined by a steep velocity gradient on the margin, particularly well documented by S-wave velocity. The outermost region of the superplume is characterized by the Rodinia slab graveyard forming a donut-shape. We develop a petrologic model for the Pacific superplume and show how larger plumes are generated at shallower depths in the mantle. We link the mechanism of formation of the superplume to the presence of the mineral post-perovskite, the phase transformation of which to perovskite is exothermic, and thus aids in transporting core heat to mantle, and finally to planetary space by plumes. We summarize the characteristics of tectonic processes operating at the CMB to propose the existence of an “anti-crust” generated through “anti-plate tectonics” at the bottom of the mantle. The chemistry of the anti-crust markedly contrasts with that of the continental crust overlying the mantle. Both the crust and the anti-crust must have increased in volume through geologic time, in close relation with the geochemical reservoirs of the Earth. The process of formation of a new superplume closely accompanies the process of development of anti-crust at the bottom of mantle, through the production of dense melt from the partial melting of recycled MORB, observed now as the ULVZ. When CMB temperature is recovered to near 4000 K through phase transformation, the recycled MORB is partially melted imparting chemical buoyancy of the andesitic residual solid which rises up from CMB, leaving behind the dense melt to sink to CMB and thus increase the mass of anti-crust. These small-scale plumes develop to a large-scale superplume through collision and amalgamation with time. When all recycled MORBs are consumed, it is the time of demise of superplume. Immediately above the CMB, anti-plate tectonics operates to develop anti-crust through the horizontal movement of accumulated slab and their partial melting. Thus, we speculate that another continent, or even a supercontinent, has developed through geologic time at the bottom of the mantle. We also evaluate the heating vs. cooling models in relation to mantle dynamics. Rising plumes control not only the rifting of supercontinents and continents, but also the Atlantic stage as seen by anchored ridge by hotspots in the last 200 Ma in the Atlantic. Therefore, we propose that the major driving force for the mantle dynamics is the heat supplied from the high-T core, and not the slab pull force by cooling. The best analogy for this is the atmospheric circulation driven by the energy from Sun.

AB  - The timing of flood basalt volcanism associated with formation of the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) is estimated from paleomagnetic and paleontologic data. Much of OJP formed rapidly in less than 3 million years during the early Aptian, at the beginning of the Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron. Crustal emplacement rates are inferred to have been several times those of the Deccan Traps. These estimates are consistent with an origin of the OJP by impingement at the base of the oceanic lithosphere by the head of a large mantle plume. Formation of the OJP may have led to a rise in sea level that induced global oceanic anoxia. Carbon dioxide emissions likely contributed to the mid-Cretaceous greenhouse climate but did not provoke major biologic extinctions.

AB  - Large low-velocity seismic anomalies have been detected in the Earth's lower mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean that are not easily explained by temperature variations alone1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. The African anomaly has been interpreted to be a northwest–southeast-trending structure3,4,5,7 with a sharp-edged linear, ridge-like morphology9,10. The Pacific anomaly, on the other hand, appears to be more rounded in shape1,2,3,4,6,7,11. Mantle models with heterogeneous composition have related these structures to dense thermochemical piles or superplumes12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. It has not been shown, however, that such models can lead to thermochemical structures that satisfy the geometrical constraints, as inferred from seismological observations. Here we present numerical models of thermochemical convection in a three-dimensional spherical geometry using plate velocities inferred for the past 119 million years20. We show that Earth's subduction history can lead to thermochemical structures similar in shape to the observed large, lower-mantle velocity anomalies. We find that subduction history tends to focus dense material into a ridge-like pile beneath Africa and a relatively more-rounded pile under the Pacific Ocean, consistent with seismic observations.

AB  - The two large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) at the base of the lower mantle are prominent features in all shear wave tomography models. Various lines of evidence suggest that the LLSVPs are thermochemical and are stable on the order of hundreds of million years. Hot spots and large igneous province eruption sites tend to cluster around the edges of LLSVPs. With 3-D global spherical dynamic models, we investigate the location of plumes and lateral movement of chemical structures, which are composed of dense, high bulk modulus material. With reasonable values of bulk modulus and density anomalies, we find that the anomalous material forms dome-like structures with steep edges, which can survive for billions of years before being entrained. We find that more plumes occur near the edges, rather than on top, of the chemical domes. Moreover, plumes near the edges of domes have higher temperatures than those atop the domes. We find that the location of the downwelling region (subduction) controls the direction and speed of the lateral movement of domes. Domes tend to move away from subduction zones. The domes could remain relatively stationary when distant from subduction but would migrate rapidly when a new subduction zone initiates above. Generally, we find that a segment of a dome edge can be stationary for 200 million years, while other segments have rapid lateral movement. In the presence of time-dependent subduction, the computations suggest that maintaining the lateral fixity of the LLSVPs at the core-mantle boundary for longer than hundreds of million years is a challenge.

AB  - The origin of mantle hotspots is a controversial topic. Only seven (‘primary’) out of 49 hotspots meet criteria aimed at detecting a very deep origin (three in the Pacific, four in the Indo-Atlantic hemisphere). In each hemisphere these move slowly, whereas there has been up to 50 mm/a motion between the two hemispheres prior to 50 Ma ago. This correlates with latitudinal shifts in the Hawaiian and Reunion hotspots, and with a change in true polar wander. We propose that hotspots may come from distinct mantle boundary layers, and that the primary ones trace shifts in quadrupolar convection in the lower mantle.

TI  - The source location of mantle plumes from 3D spherical models of mantle convection
AU  - Li, Mingming
AU  - Zhong, Shijie
T2  - Earth and Planetary Science Letters
AB  - Mantle plumes are thought to originate from thermal boundary layers such as Earth's core-mantle boundary (CMB), and may cause intraplate volcanism such as large igneous provinces (LIPs) on the Earth's surface. Previous studies showed that the original eruption sites of deep-sourced LIPs for the last 200 Myrs occur mostly above the margins of the seismically-observed large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the lowermost mantle. However, the mechanism that leads to the distribution of the LIPs is not clear. The location of the LIPs is largely determined by the source location of mantle plumes, but the question is under what conditions mantle plumes form outside, at the edges, or above the middle of LLSVPs. Here, we perform 3D geodynamic calculations and theoretical analyses to study the plume source location in the lowermost mantle. We find that a factor of five decrease of thermal expansivity and a factor of two increase of thermal diffusivity from the surface to the CMB, which are consistent with mineral physics studies, significantly reduce the number of mantle plumes forming far outside of thermochemical piles (i.e., LLSVPs). An increase of mantle viscosity in the lowermost mantle also reduces number of plumes far outside of piles. In addition, we find that strong plumes preferentially form at/near the edges of piles and are generally hotter than that forming on top of piles, which may explain the observations that most LIPs occur above LLSVP margins. However, some plumes originated at pile edges can later appear above the middle of piles due to lateral movement of the plumes and piles and morphologic changes of the piles. ∼65–70% strong plumes are found within 10 degrees from pile edges in our models. Although plate motion exerts significant controls over the large-scale mantle convection in the lower mantle, mantle plume formation at the CMB remains largely controlled by thermal boundary layer instability which makes it difficult to predict geographic locations of most mantle plumes. However, all our models show consistently strong plumes originating from the lowermost mantle beneath Iceland, supporting a deep mantle plume origin of the Iceland volcanism.

TI  - Latest pulse of Earth: Evidence for a mid-Cretaceous superplume
AU  - Larson, R. L.
T2  - Geology
AB  - A calculation of Earth's ocean crustal budget for the past 150 m.y. reveals a 50% to 75% increase in ocean crust formation rate between 120 and 80 Ma. This "pulse" in ocean crust production is seen both in spreading-rate increases from ocean ridges and in the age distribution of oceanic plateaus. It is primarily a Pacific Ocean phenomenon with an abrupt onset, and peak production rates occurred between 120 and 100 Ma. The pulse decreased in intensity from 100 to 80 Ma, and at 80 Ma rates dropped significantly. There was a continued decrease from 80 to 30 Ma with a secondary peak near the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary at 65 Ma. For the past 30 m.y., ocean crust has formed at a nearly steady rate. Because the pulse is seen primarily in Pacific oceanic plateau and ridge production, and coincides with the long Cretaceous interval of normal magnetic polarity, I interpret it as a "superplume" that originated at about 125 Ma near the core/mantle boundary, rose by convection through the entire mantle, and erupted beneath the mid-Cretaceous Pacific basin. The present-day South Pacific "superswell" under Tahiti is probably the nearly exhausted remnant of the original upwelling. How this superplume stopped magnetic field reversals for 41 m.y. is a matter of speculation, but it probably involved significant alteration of the temperature structure at the core/mantle boundary and the convective behavior of the outer core.

T2  - Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors
AB  - The dynamics of Earth’s lowermost mantle exert significant control on the formation of mantle plumes and the core-mantle boundary (CMB) heat flux. However, it is not clear if and how the variation of CMB heat flux and mantle plume activity are related. Here, we perform geodynamic model experiments that show how temporal variations in CMB heat flux and pulses of mantle plumes are related to morphologic changes of the thermochemical piles of large-scale compositional heterogeneities in Earth’s lowermost mantle, represented by the large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs). We find good correlation between the morphologic changes of the thermochemical piles and the time variation of CMB heat flux. The morphology of the thermochemical piles is significantly altered during the initiation and ascent of strong mantle plumes, and the changes in pile morphology cause variations in the local and the total CMB heat flux. Our modeling results indicate that plume-induced episodic variations of CMB heat flux link geomagnetic superchrons to pulses of surface volcanism, although the relative timing of these two phenomena remains problematic. We also find that the density distribution in thermochemical piles is heterogeneous, and that the piles are denser on average than the surrounding mantle when both thermal and chemical effects are included.

TI  - Advection of plumes in mantle flow: implications for hotspot motion, mantle viscosity and plume distribution
AU  - Steinberger*, Bernhard
AU  - O’Connell, Richard J.
T2  - Geophysical Journal International
AB  - Because of their slow relative motion, hotspots, mainly in the Pacific, are often used as a reference frame for defining plate motions. A coherent motion of all Pacific hotspots relative to the deep mantle may, however, bias the hotspot reference frame. Numerical results on the advection of plumes, which are thought to cause the hotspots on the Earth’s surface, in a large-scale mantle flow field are therefore presented. Bringing the results into agreement with observations also leads to conclusions regarding the viscosity structure of the Earth’s mantle, as well as the sources and distribution of plumes. The abrupt change in direction of the Hawaiian–Emperor chain implies an upper-mantle viscosity under the Pacific of ∼ 1.5 × 1020 Pa s or less. Slow relative motion of hotspots requires high lower-mantle viscosity, unless hotspots are located at large-scale stationary upwellings that are currently unresolved by seismic tomography. For our preferred model, we obtain coherent motion of Pacific hotspots in a reference frame of no net rotation, as well as coherent motion relative to African hotspots, caused by return flow antiparallel to plate motion. Advection and regional differences in life expectancy can to a large part explain the distribution of plumes in relation to ridges, subduction zones (present and past) and seismic anomalies. Plume conduits are substantially tilted in the lower mantle. The surface motion of hotspots is often smaller than the advection rate of plume conduits in the lowermost mantle.

TI  - On the uncertainties in hot spot reconstructions and the significance of moving hot spot reference frames

AB  - It is widely accepted that substantial relative motion has occurred between the Indo-Atlantic and Pacific hot spots since the Late Cretaceous. At the same time, a fixed Indo-Atlantic hot spot reference frame has been argued for and used since the advent of plate tectonics, implying relatively little motion between the hot spots in this domain since about 130 Ma. Most plumes purported to have caused these hot spots, while being advected in the global-scale mantle flow field, are assumed to move an order of magnitude more slowly than plates. However, the lifetime of a plume may be over ∼100 Myr, and the integrated motion of a plume is expected to be significant over these times. The uncertainties inherent in hot spot reconstructions are of a magnitude similar to the expected plume motion, and so any differences between a fixed and moving frame of reference must be discernible beyond the level of these uncertainties. We present a method for constraining hot spot reconstruction uncertainties, similar to that in use for relative plate motion. We use a modified Hellinger criterion of fit for the hot spot problem, using track geometries and radiometric dating, and derive covariance matrices for our Indo-Atlantic rotations for the last 120 Myr. However, any given mantle convection model introduces additional uncertainties into such models, based on its model parameters and starting conditions (e.g., choice of global tomography model, viscosity profile, nature of mantle phase transitions). We use an interactive evolutionary approach, where we constrain the hot spot motion resulting from convection models to fit paleomagnetic constraints, and converge on an acceptable motion solution by varying unknowns over several generations of simulations. Our hot spot motion model shows large motion (5–10°) of the Indo-Atlantic hot spots for times >80 Ma, consistent with available paleomagnetic constraints. The differences between the fixed and moving hot spot reference frames are not discernible over the level of uncertainty in such rotations for times <80 Ma.

AB  - Large igneous provinces, as the surface expression of deep mantle processes, play a key role in the evolution of the planet. Here we analyse the geochemical record and timing of the Pacific Ocean Large Igneous Provinces and preserved accreted terranes to reconstruct the history of pulses of mantle plume upwellings and their relation with a deep-rooted source like the Pacific large low-shear velocity Province during the Mid-Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous. Petrological modelling and geochemical data suggest the need of interaction between these deep-rooted upwellings and mid-ocean ridges in pulses separated by ∼10–20 Ma, to generate the massive volumes of melt preserved today as oceanic plateaus. These pulses impacted the marine biota resulting in episodes of anoxia and mass extinctions shortly after their eruption.

TI  - The influence of uncertain mantle density and viscosity structures on the calculations of deep mantle flow and lateral motion of plumes
AU  - Li, Mingming
T2  - Geophysical Journal International
AB  - Mantle plumes form from thermal boundary layers, such as Earth's core–mantle boundary. As plumes rise towards the surface, they are laterally deflected by the surrounding mantle flow that is governed by deep mantle density and viscosity structures. The lateral motions of mantle plumes carry information of deep mantle structure and dynamics and are used to setup reference frames by which absolute plate motions are reconstructed. In this study, we compare two methods to compute deep mantle flow and lateral motion of plumes. In mantle convection (MC) models, the mantle flow field and lateral motions of plumes are determined by solving conservation equations forward-in-time from given initial conditions. In plume advection (PA) models, approximate viscosity and present-day density structures are used to calculate present-day mantle flow which is then propagated backward-in-time assuming zero thermal diffusion, and plume conduits are represented by continuous lines and are passively advected within the background mantle flow. The question is how assumptions in PA models influence the predictions of deep mantle flow and plume lateral motions. Here, we perform purely thermal MC models and thermochemical MC models with intrinsically dense materials in the lowermost mantle. The deep mantle flow and plume lateral motions are determined accurately in each MC model. We also perform PA models using the approximated present-day viscosity and temperature structures in these MC models. We find that PA models without considering temperature-dependence of viscosity and/or only using long wavelength present-day temperature structure (up to degree 20) often lead to an average of ∼50–60 per cent and ∼60–200 per cent differences of present-day mantle flow velocities than purely thermal MC models and thermochemical MC models, respectively. By propagating inaccurate flow fields backward-in-time in PA models often cause even larger errors of mantle flow velocities in the past. Even using the same parameters and starting from the same present-day mantle flow fields as in MC models, the PA models still show an average of ∼10–30 per cent misfit of mantle flow velocities after ∼40 Ma.In addition, we show that errors of mantle flow fields in PA models can cause ∼100–600 per cent differences of plume lateral motions than that constrained in MC models in the past 60 Ma. Even we use the mantle flow in MC models to advected virtual plumes in PA models, the virtual plumes could still show ∼50–300 per cent difference of lateral motions than dynamic plumes in MC models if the virtual plumes do not start with the same locations and/or shapes as plumes in MC models. We also find virtual plumes in PA models initiated at different locations and/or with different shapes can be later advected to similar locations, suggesting that the lateral motions of plumes in PA models can be non-unique. Therefore, it is important to consider the build-in assumptions of PA models when interpreting their predictions on deep mantle flow field and plume lateral motions. The accuracy of PA models would improve as we gain better understanding on Earth's deep mantle structure and dynamics.

AB  - The Hawaiian-Emperor hotspot track has a prominent bend, which has served as the basis for the theory that the Hawaiian hotspot, fixed in the deep mantle, traced a change in plate motion. However, paleomagnetic and radiometric age data from samples recovered by ocean drilling define an age-progressive paleolatitude history, indicating that the Emperor Seamount trend was principally formed by the rapid motion (over 40 millimeters per year) of the Hawaiian hotspot plume during Late Cretaceous to early-Tertiary times (81 to 47 million years ago). Evidence for motion of the Hawaiian plume affects models of mantle convection and plate tectonics, changing our understanding of terrestrial dynamics.

TI  - Lateral Motion of Mantle Plumes in 3-D Geodynamic Models
AU  - Li, Mingming

T2  - Geophysical Research Letters
AB  - It has been proposed that hot spot tracks are caused by moving rigid plates above relatively stationary hot spots. However, the fixity of hot spots remains under debate. Here, we perform 3-D very high resolution (<25 km laterally) global mantle convection models with realistic convection vigor to investigate the lateral motion of mantle plumes. We find that the lateral motion of plumes beneath the Pacific plate is statistically similar to that beneath the Indo-Atlantic plates. In the past 80 Ma, the majority (>90%) of plumes move laterally with an average speed of 0–20 mm/year under the no-net-rotation reference frame, and there are a small portion ( 10–20%) of plumes whose lateral motion is less than 5 mm/year. The geodynamic modeling results are statistically in a good agreement with the hot spot motions in the last 5 Ma estimated from observation-based kinematic models. Our results suggest a small-to-moderate (0–20 mm/year) lateral motion of most plume-induced hot spots.

AB  - The supercontinent cycle of episodic assembly and breakup of almost all continents on Earth is commonly considered the longest period variation to affect mantle convection. However, global zircon Hf isotopic signatures and seawater Sr isotope ratios suggest the existence of a longer-term variation trend that is twice the duration of the supercontinent cycle. Here we propose that since ∼2 billion years ago the superocean surrounding a supercontinent, as well as the circum-supercontinent subduction girdle, survive every second supercontinent cycle. This interpretation is in agreement with global palaeogeography and is supported by variations in passive margin, orogen, and mineral deposit records that each exhibits both ∼500–700 million years periodic signal and a 1000–1500 million years variation trend. We suggest that the supercontinent cycle is modulated by an assembly that alternates between dominantly extroversion after a more complete breakup, and dominantly introversion after an incomplete breakup of the previous supercontinent.

AB  - The breakup of Pangea in the Jurassic saw the opening of major ocean basins at the expense of older Tethyan and Pacific oceanic plates. Although the Tethyan seafloor spreading history has been lost to subduction, proxy indicators from multiple generations of Tethyan ribbon terranes, as well as the active margin geological histories of volcanism and ophiolite obduction events can be used to reconstruct these ancient oceanic plates. The plate reconstructions presented in this study reconcile observations from ocean basins and the onshore geological record to provide a regional synthesis, embedded in a global plate motion model, of the India-Eurasia convergence history, the accretionary growth of Southeast Asia and the Tethyan-Pacific tectonic link through the New Guinea margin. The global plate motion model presented in this study captures the time-dependent evolution of plates and their tectonic boundaries since 160Ma, which are assimilated as surface boundary conditions for numerical experiments of mantle convection. We evaluate subducted slab locations and geometries predicted by forward mantle flow models against P- and S-wave seismic tomography models. This approach harnesses modern plate reconstruction techniques, mantle convection models with imposed one-sided subduction, and constraints from the surface geology to address a number of unresolved Tethyan geodynamic controversies. Our synthesis reveals that north-dipping subduction beneath Eurasia in the latest Jurassic consumed the Meso-Tethys, and suggests that northward slab pull opened the younger Neo-Tethyan ocean basin from ~155Ma. We model the rifting of ‘Argoland’, representing the East Java and West Sulawesi continental fragments, as a northward transfer of continental terranes in the latest Jurassic from the northwest Australian shelf – likely colliding first with parts of the Woyla intra-oceanic arc in the mid-Cretaceous, and accreting to the Borneo (Sundaland) core by ~80Ma. The Neo-Tethyan ridge was likely consumed along an intra-oceanic subduction zone south of Eurasia from ~105Ma, leading to a major change in the motion of the Indian Plate by ~100Ma, as observed in the Wharton Basin fracture zone bends. We investigate the geodynamic consequences of long-lived intra-oceanic subduction within the Neo-Tethys, requiring a two-stage India-Eurasia collision involving first contact between Greater India and the Kohistan-Ladakh Arc sometime between ~60 and 50Ma, followed by continent-continent collision from ~47Ma. Our models suggest that the Sunda slab kink beneath northwest Sumatra in the mantle transition zone results from the rotation and extrusion of Indochina from ~30Ma. Our results are also the first to reproduce the enigmatic Proto South China Sea slab beneath northern Borneo, as well as the Tethyan/Woyla slab that is predicted at mid-mantle depths south of Sumatra. Further east, our revised reconstructions of the New Guinea margin, notably the evolution of the Sepik composite terrane and the Maramuni subduction zone, produce a better match with seismic tomography than previous reconstructions, and account for a slab at ~30°S beneath Lake Eyre that has been overridden by the northward advancing Australian continent. Our plate reconstructions provide a framework to study changing patterns of oceanic circulation, long-term sea level driven by changes in ocean basin volume, as well as major biogeographic dispersal pathways that have resulted from Gondwana fragmentation and accretion of Tethyan terranes to south- and southeast-Eurasia.

AB  - The westward subduction of the Pacific plate interacted with the northward subduction of the eastern Neo-Tethys plate in the Early Cretaceous. However, the subduction polarities between these two plates in the Early Cretaceous is not well constrained. The proto-Philippine arc is suggested to have originated at the Pacific – Neo-Tethys intersection in the SW Pacific in the latest Jurassic – Early Cretaceous, and can provide information about the ancient interaction between these two plates. In this study, the oldest known Early Cretaceous mantle-derived arc volcanic rocks and slab-melting generated adakites occurring in the Philippine arc have been studied for Pb, Sr, Nd and Hf isotopes to discriminate the provenance of their mantle sources and/or subduction components. The 126–118 Ma Kansi island arc volcanics have Pacific-type Pb isotopes, suggesting that the subduction components in the source are mainly from the subducted Pacific plate. Their Hf-Nd isotopes give support to a mantle source that is isotopically transitional Pacific-Indian type. The formation of the Kansi volcanics dates the subduction of the Pacific plate under the transitional Pacific-Indian mantle as Early Cretaceous. The subsequent generation of the 110 Ma Kansi adakitic diorites with the similar Pacific-type Pb isotopes indicates further partial melting of the subducted Pacific plate. In contrast, the post-110 Ma Lutopan adakitic diorites have Indian-type Pb isotopes, indicating the subsequent subduction of an Indian-type oceanic slab in the eastern Neo-Tethys tectonic regime. Therefore, the proto-Philippine arc is constrained to have originated at the intersection between Indian-type and Pacific-type oceanic crusts and mantle domains. The successive generation of these Early Cretaceous arc rocks in the Philippines indicates that a transformation of the tectonic regime from southwestward Pacific subduction to northeastward subduction of the eastern Neo-Tethys plate in the SW Pacific Ocean occurred at ca. 110 Ma, due to the abrupt change in drifting direction of the Pacific plate.

AB  - Plate tectonics is primarily driven by the constant gravitational pull of slabs where oceanic lithosphere sinks into the mantle at subduction zones. Under stable plate boundary configurations, changes in plate motion are then thought to occur gradually. Surprisingly, recent high-resolution Indian plate reconstructions revealed rapid (2–3 Million-year) plate velocity oscillations of ±50 %. We show, through numerical experiments, that the buckling of slabs in the mantle transition zone causes such oscillations. This buckling results from the deceleration of slabs as they sink into the lower mantle. The amplitude and period of buckling-associated oscillations depend on average subduction velocity and the available space in the mantle transition zone. The oscillations also affect the upper plate which may explain enigmatic observations of episodic deformation and fluid flow in subduction-related orogens. We infer that the slab pull that drives plate tectonics is generated in just the top few hundred kilometers of the mantle.

T2  - Earth and Planetary Science Letters
AB  - A sheet of viscous fluid poured onto a surface buckles periodically to generate a pile of regular folds. Recent tomographic images beneath subduction zones, together with quantitative fluid mechanical scaling laws, suggest that a similar instability can occur when slabs of subducted oceanic lithosphere encounter enhanced resistance to penetration at 660 km depth. Beneath subduction zones such as Central America and Java, the fast anomalies in elastic wavespeed are too broad (≥400 km) to be explained by simple compressional thickening of subducted lithosphere that is initially 50–100 km thick. By contrast, a periodic buckling mechanism can account for both the characteristic ‘wedge’ shapes of the anomalies and for their widths, which agree closely with those predicted by the scaling laws. In addition to providing a plausible physical interpretation of tomographic observations beneath some subduction zones, buckling instabilities have important consequences for other aspects of global geodynamics such as tectonic plate reconstructions, interpretation of geoid anomalies, and modeling of secular changes in Earth's moment of inertia.

TI  - Decoupling of plate-asthenosphere motion caused by non-linear viscosity during slab folding in the transition zone
AU  - Billen, Magali I.

T2  - Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors
AB  - Although most present-day subduction zones are in trench retreat, plate reconstructions and geological observations show that individual margins experience episodes of advancing, retreating or stationary trench motion with time-variable subduction rates. However, most laboratory and numerical simulations predict steady plate velocities and sustained trench retreat unless the slab experiences folding in the transition zone. Using 2D dynamical models of subduction with a mobile trench and overriding plate, we find that rapid sinking of the slab during folding causes a reduction in asthenosphere viscosity through the non-linear rheology, which allows the overriding plate to move in the opposite direction of the asthenosphere. This decoupling of the direction of plate and asthenosphere flow allows for episodes of rapid trench advance after each slab folding event. By analyzing the interaction between slab deformation (sinking direction and speed), stress-induced changes in asthenosphere viscosity, asthenosphere flow and plate motions, we show that there are three modes of slab-flow-plate interaction: 1) coupled trench retreat during rapid vertical sinking, 2) coupled trench advance during prograde sinking of the slab, and 3) decoupled, rapid trench advance during folding with prograde motion of the shallow slab and retrograde motion of the deep slab. These results show that non-linear viscosity plays an important role in determining the force balance controlling trench motion and conversely that trench motion can be used as a constraint on the asthenosphere viscosity underlying the overriding plate. In addition, cooling by several hundreds of degrees during episodes of fast subduction could lead to a reduction in slab dehydration and fluid-induced melting in the mantle wedge. Such cold episodes would also likely lead to time-variability in the water content and related geochemical tracers in erupted lavas, as well as the amount of water being transported by slabs into the deep mantle.

T2  - Geophysical Journal International
AB  - Seismic refraction profiles were carried out in 1983 and 1987 throughout the Kerguelen Isles (southern Indian Ocean, Terres Australes &amp; Antarctiques Franqaises, TAAF) and thereafter at sea on the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau during the MD66/KeOBS cruise in 1991. These profiles substantiate the existence of oceanic‐type crust beneath the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau stretching from 46°s to 55°S, including the archipelago. Seismic velocities within both structures are in the range of those encountered in ‘standard’ oceanic crust. However, the Kerguelen Isles and the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau differ strikingly in their velocity‐depth structure. Unlike the Kerguelen Isles, the thickening of the crust below the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau is caused by a 17 km thick layer 3. Velocities of 7.4 km s−1 or so within the transition to mantle zone below the Kerguelen Isles are ascribed to the lower crust intruded and/or underplated by upper mantle material. The crust‐mantle boundary below the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau is abrupt and devoid of any underplated material. The difference in structure between the northern edge of the Kerguelen Plateau (including the archipelago) and the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau may be related to variability of the time‐dependent hotspot activity. The Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau was emplaced during the Cretaceous time (110 Ma) when the volcanic output rate of the Kerguelen Plateau and the Ninetyeast Ridge was high (as well as high potential temperature). The northernmost Kerguelen Plateau and the archipelago were emplaced during Tertiary time (40–45 Ma), as the volcanic output rate reduced. Furthermore, intraplate volcanism continued in the Kerguelen archipelago for at least 40 Ma. The isostatic compensation of the Kerguelen Isles and the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau is achieved by low‐density mantle material, as shown by refraction and geoid studies.The velocity‐depth structure below the Kerguelen Isles is similar to that found below intraplate oceanic islands such as Hawaii. Despite the differences in age, the crust below Iceland (0Ma) and the Kerguelen Plateau (100–120 Ma) are strikingly akin. The similarity between the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau and Iceland, then, strongly supports a similar origin for both structures, the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau being a fossil equivalent of present‐day Iceland.Crustal thickening beneath the Kerguelen‐Heard Plateau, which may result from an Iceland‐type setting (i.e. an active spreading centre over a hotspot), is mostly produced by thickening of layer 3, layer 2 representing 25 per cent only of the thickness of the igneous crust. The Kerguelen Isles, despite the initial volcanism near the active Southeast Indian Ridge, behave as a midplate volcanic island and are definitely not representative of the whole Kerguelen Plateau structure.

AU  - Davy, Bryan

AU  - Werner, Reinhard
T2  - Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems
AB  - Seismic reflection profiles across the Hikurangi Plateau Large Igneous Province and adjacent margins reveal the faulted volcanic basement and overlying Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary units as well as the structure of the paleoconvergent Gondwana margin at the southern plateau limit. The Hikurangi Plateau crust can be traced 50–100 km southward beneath the Chatham Rise where subduction cessation timing and geometry are interpreted to be variable along the margin. A model fit of the Hikurangi Plateau back against the Manihiki Plateau aligns the Manihiki Scarp with the eastern margin of the Rekohu Embayment. Extensional and rotated block faults which formed during the breakup of the combined Manihiki-Hikurangi plateau are interpreted in seismic sections of the Hikurangi Plateau basement. Guyots and ridge-like seamounts which are widely scattered across the Hikurangi Plateau are interpreted to have formed at 99–89 Ma immediately following Hikurangi Plateau jamming of the Gondwana convergent margin at ∼100 Ma. Volcanism from this period cannot be separately resolved in the seismic reflection data from basement volcanism; hence seamount formation during Manihiki-Hikurangi Plateau emplacement and breakup (125–120 Ma) cannot be ruled out. Seismic reflection data and gravity modeling suggest the 20-Ma-old Hikurangi Plateau choked the Cretaceous Gondwana convergent margin within 5 Ma of entry. Subsequent uplift of the Chatham Rise and slab detachment has led to the deposition of a Mesozoic sedimentary unit that thins from ∼1 km thickness northward across the plateau. The contrast with the present Hikurangi Plateau subduction beneath North Island, New Zealand, suggests a possible buoyancy cutoff range for LIP subduction consistent with earlier modeling.

AB  - The Japanese Guyots, Wake Guyots, and Mid-Pacific Mountains are part of a broad area of Cretaceous volcanism in the western Pacific termed the “Darwin Rise.” Based on Seabeam bathymetric data we classify these drowned volcanic islands as: type “A,” those that advanced to the atoll stage before final submergence; type “B,” those that drowned at the barrier reef stage; and type “V,” those with little or no reef material on their volcanic summits. Widespread evidence for karst topography extending to depths of 200 m on the summits of A and B guyots sheds new light on events leading to the synchronous extinction of reefs on the Darwin Rise in the mid-Cretaceous. We propose that after the formation of the reefs on the A and B guyots, the entire region was elevated at approximately the Aptian-Albian boundary (113 Ma) to form a superswell similar to that existing now in French Polynesia. The type V guyots formed on this anomalously shallow lithosphere. The demise of the reefs was the direct result of the rise of this superswell, although climate factors may have prevented reef recolonization following its later subsidence.

TI  - Isotope geochemistry of the Darwin Rise seamounts and the nature of long-term mantle dynamics beneath the south central Pacific
AU  - Janney, Philip E.
AU  - Castillo, Paterno R.
T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth
AB  - The Darwin Rise region in the west central Pacific Ocean contains an extraordinarily large number of Cretaceous seamounts with isotopic compositions spanning a range nearly equal to that of the global ocean island basalt data set. These edifices formed in what is now the south central Pacific, which is characterized by anomalously shallow lithosphere and concentrated intraplate volcanism. We present Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic data for Darwin Rise seamount basalts recovered by Ocean Drilling Program Leg 143 and Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 7. Comparison of chemical and isotopic data for Darwin Rise and French Polynesian volcanoes confirms that the same range of distinct sources has been tapped by intraplate volcanism in the south central Pacific since the Early Cretaceous. Moreover, the increased data coverage reveals that most of the isotopic variation within Darwin Rise volcanic chains can be explained by shallow mixing between plumes and asthenosphere or oceanic lithosphere. On the basis of geophysical and geochemical evidence we propose an alternative model for volcanism in the south central Pacific from the Cretaceous to the present. Instead of the conventional hypothesis involving a few long-lived mantle plumes, we propose that numerous hotspots formed and died out in the region over the past 130 Myr. We envision that these hotspots are the surface expression of “plumelets” continually separating from a shallow thermochemical boundary layer at the top of a large heterogeneous body of material which rose from the lower mantle. These plumelets rise and melt beneath the south central Pacific lithosphere, producing chains of volcanic edifices which terminate when they become exhausted of melt. The surfacing of multiple plumelets in proximity can explain the complex temporal, spatial, and geochemical patterns of volcanism observed in most volcanic chains in the south central Pacific and Darwin Rise.

TI  - Compensation of Cretaceous Seamounts of the Darwin Rise, northwest Pacific Ocean
AU  - Wolfe, Cecily J.
AU  - McNutt, Marcia K.
T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth
AB  - We estimate the elastic thickness Te for the Pacific plate at the time of volcanism for approximately 60 guyots of Cretaceous age in the Japanese, Wake, and Mid-Pacific Mountain seamount groups of the northwest Pacific. The values of Te are constrained by comparing synthetic gravity and deflection of the vertical computed from digital bathymetry assuming regional compensation models to potential field data derived from Seasat radar altimetry. The amplitude of the gridded Seasat gravity field over the seamounts is consistent with Te values between 5 and 15 km, but these values represent only lower bounds since the 100-km spacing of satellite tracks may undersample the gravity for seamounts lying between adjacent passes. Direct modeling of the deflection of the vertical along individual satellite tracks avoids this distribution bias but can lead to errors if the bathymetric feature is mislocated with respect to the satellite coordinate system. Nevertheless, for no seamount does the root-mean-square (RMS) difference between observed and predicted deflection of the vertical show a distinct minimum for elastic plate thickness greater than 15 km. However, for some features the RMS minimum is unconstrained, allowing Te greater than 15 km. Given the possible bias in the modeling of satellite data, the low values for elastic plate thickness were confirmed for the Japanese and Wake group using shipborne gravity data and multibeam bathymetry collected during the Roundabout leg 10 expedition, supplemented with published Navy sonar array sounding system (SASS) bathymetry. The analysis of shipborne data constrains most elastic plate thickness values to between 10 and 15 km for crustal densities between 2600 and 2800 kg/m3. The low values for elastic plate thickness for these Cretaceous guyots that formed in the area of the “Darwin Rise” suggest either that they formed on lithosphere less than 40 m.y. old or that older lithosphere was reheated near the time of volcanism. While the first possibility is permitted by age data from the Mid-Pacific Mountains, radiometric dates and magnetic lineations from the Japanese and Wakes are more consistent with formation of these seamount groups on older, thermally anomalous lithosphere, such as that which is thought to exist presently beneath the volcanoes of French Polynesia.

AB  - We present new sedimentary flux data confirming that a large pulse of erosion affected the Southern African Plateau in the Late Cretaceous and is likely to be related to a major uplift episode of the plateau. This short phase of erosion (i.e., less than 30 Myr in duration) has commonly been difficult to reconcile with a mantle origin for the plateau anomalous uplift: given its size, the rise of the African superplume is likely to have lasted much longer. Here we demonstrate by using a simple model for fluvial erosion that tilting of the continent as it rides over a wide dynamic topography high cannot only cause rapid uplift of the plateau but also trigger continent-wide drainage reorganization, leading to substantial denudation in a relatively short amount of time. The amplitude and short duration of the sedimentary pulse are best reproduced by assuming a strong erodibility contrast between the Karoo sedimentary and volcanic rocks and the underlying basement. We also present a new compilation of paleoclimate indicators that shows a transition from arid to very humid conditions approximately at the onset of the documented erosional pulse, suggesting that climate may have also played a role in triggering the denudation. The diachronism of the sedimentary flux between the eastern and western margins of the plateau and the temporal and geographic coincidence between the uplift and kimberlite eruptions are, however, better explained by our tilt hypothesis driven by the migration of the continent over a fixed source of mantle upwelling.

AB  - Flow in the sublithospheric mantle is increasingly invoked as a mechanism to explain both modern and past surface topography, but the importance of this phenomenon and its influence at different localities are debated. Southern Africa is an elevated continental shield proposed to represent dynamically supported topography. However, this region is also characterized by a complex lithospheric architecture variably affected by Cretaceous heating, thinning, and metasomatic alteration. We used apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry on 15 Cretaceous kimberlites from an ∼600 km long transect across the Kaapvaal Craton, combined with information from xenoliths in these pipes, to determine the plateau interior erosion history. The goal was to determine the relationships with lithospheric modification patterns and thereby better isolate the sublithospheric contribution to elevation. The results document a wave of erosion from west to east across the craton from ∼120 to <60 Ma, initially focused along paleorivers and then retreating as a scarp across the landscape. This spatially variable erosion event was associated with limited modification of the Archean cratonic lithospheric mantle as recorded by mantle xenoliths and xenocrysts, implying that dynamic buoyancy sources may be required to explain the elevations. In contrast, off-craton to the southwest, a more pronounced regional erosion phase at ∼110–90 Ma was coincident with significant modification of the Proterozoic lithospheric mantle. This relationship suggests that lithospheric processes were more important contributors to erosion and topographic change off-craton than on-craton. Together, these results suggest that lithospheric architecture can have an important control on the surface expression of mantle dynamics.

T2  - Earth and Planetary Science Letters
AB  - Recently continental paleomagnetic data rotated into a hotspot reference frame have been used to suggest the Earth rotated 18° with respect to the spin axis at 110 Ma. We test this true polar wander (TPW) hypothesis using paleomagnetic data from widespread granitic rocks of cratonal North America. These data conflict with TPW predictions leading to rejection of the hypothesis. The calculated polar displacement is instead consistent with motion of the Atlantic hotspots during the mid-Cretaceous. This analysis suggests that the time-averaged position of the spin axis has deviated by no more than ∼5° over the last 130 million yr, indicating that mantle mass heterogeneities have not changed rapidly enough to drive TPW.

AB  - The fixity of hotspots and mantle plume locations has long been axiomatic. If the assumption of fixed hotspots is granted, ‘absolute’ plate motions and movements of the spin axis with respect to the hotspot framework, defined by some as True Polar Wander (TPW), can be determined. However, this assumption can be tested by paleomagnetic data, and such tests are gradually raising some doubts about the fixity of hotspots. The result is that discrepancies between Cretaceous and Tertiary hotspot and paleomagnetic reference frames are now beginning to be interpreted as the result of plume drift within a convective mantle. In the Indo–Atlantic, hotspots have remained relatively stationary with respect to the spin axis for the last 95 million yr. However, the Pacific hotspots, notably Hawaii, appear to have undergone large-scale southward drift with respect to the spin axis during the Early Tertiary. Global paleomagnetic data do not indicate that any TPW occurred during the Late Cretaceous or Tertiary. Although the Early Cretaceous paleomagnetic and hotspot frames for the Indo–Atlantic realm can be interpreted as slow TPW, direct estimates of paleolatitude and hotspot motion, in particular the Kerguelen hotspot, challenge TPW as a global phenomenon. At present, we consider that the large Early Cretaceous discrepancy between hotspot and paleomagnetic data is best explained by southward drift of the Atlantic hotspots prior to ∼95 Ma.

TI  - Thermochemical structures within a spherical mantle: Superplumes or piles?
AU  - McNamara, Allen K.
AU  - Zhong, Shijie
T2  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth
AB  - Heterogeneous compositional mantle models are frequently invoked to explain some observations obtained from geochemistry and seismology. In particular, two regions in the Earth's lower mantle, under the Pacific and Africa, are often interpreted as being either piles or superplumes of dense material. We perform numerical modeling of thermochemical convection in a three-dimensional spherical geometry to investigate whether the geometry can focus a dense chemical component into a small number of isolated, rounded piles or superplumes of material. We study the effect of temperature and compositionally dependent viscosity, and we find two different modes of dense layer deformation. Temperature-dependent rheology leads to a low-viscosity dense layer which is passively swept aside by downwellings into linear piles that are spread throughout the entire lower mantle. The addition of compositionally dependent rheology in which the dense layer is more viscous results in active deformation of the dense material, forming large, isolated superplumes. Our results indicate that piles and superplumes are separate features which, in general, do not occur together and, in order for isolated, rounded superplumes to form, an intrinsic compositional viscosity increase is required for the dense material.
